# RyansDB

## What is RyansDB?

This project was designed to be a relational database and handle all connections using its own protocol (which hasn't been developed yet).

The main goal of this code is to teach (and primarily learn) about how a database operates behind the scenes. The idea here is to be as simple as possible to convey the idea of teaching about databases.

Of course, I would like to add something more unique into the project, and i this database would be a relational database GPU-based


## What do we have ?
