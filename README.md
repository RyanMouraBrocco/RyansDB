# RyansDB

## What is RyansDB?

This project was designed to be a database (I haven't determined its core principle yet!) and handle all connections using its own protocol (which hasn't been developed yet).

The main goal of this code is to teach (and primarily learn) about how a database operates behind the scenes. The idea here is to be as simple as possible to convey the idea of teaching about databases.

Of course, I would like to add something more unique into the project,  and probably will when I define the core principle of the database


## What do we have ?

We have abstractions of the socket and TCP connections.

## TO DO

[] Ensure connection stability even when something in the network goes wrong.<br/>
[] Begin using the ResultPattern to handle errors more effectively.<br/>
[] Create a protocol to receive commands and return results.<br/>
